# Configuration Options

The following TypeScript definitions outline the parameters for the `createTenderizeConfig` function.
These parameters include configurations for tenderizers, chains, tokens, and token metadata.

```typescript filename="Params" copy
export type TenderizeConfigOptions = {
  appName: string;
  tenderizers: TenderizersConfig;
  chains: TenderizeChains;
  tokens?: TokenSlugEnums[];
  tokenMetadata?: {
    [key in TokenSlugEnums]?: TokenMetadata;
  };
};

export type TokenMetadata = {
  name: string;
  avatar?: string;
};
```

## App Name

When initializing your application configuration, you need to provide a value for the `appName`.
This value should be a string that represents the name of your application.
It is recommended to choose a unique and descriptive name to avoid confusion with other applications.

## Tokens Configuration

The `tokens:` parameter allows you to specify which tokens should be supported by the Tenderize SDK.
Here’s how it works:

```typescript filename="TokenConfigDetail" copy
import { TokenSlugEnums, createTenderizeConfig } from "@tenderize/sdk";

const config = createTenderizeConfig({
  appName: "Tenderize App",
  tenderizers: TENDERIZERS,
  chains: CHAINS,
  tokens: [TokenSlugEnums.MATIC, TokenSlugEnums.LIVEPEER, TokenSlugEnums.GRAPH],
  apiKey: ALCHEMY_API_KEY as string,
  walletConnectProjectId: WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID as string,
});
```

### Default Tokens

If no `tokens` array is provided, the SDK will default to supporting the following tokens: `TokenSlugEnums.MATIC`, `TokenSlugEnums.LIVEPEER`, and `TokenSlugEnums.GRAPH`.

### Custom Tokens

You can customize the tokens by providing an array of `TokenSlugEnums` values. For example, `[TokenSlugEnums.MATIC, TokenSlugEnums.LIVEPEER]` specifies that only MATIC and LIVEPEER tokens should be supported.

### Single Token

You can also specify a single token, e.g., `[TokenSlugEnums.MATIC]`, to support only MATIC tokens.

### Token Type `TokenSlugEnums`

The `TokenSlugEnums` enumeration defines the supported tokens within the Tenderize SDK.
Each token is associated with a unique string identifier,
making it easy to reference and manage tokens in your application.

```typescript filename="TokenSlugEnums" copy
export enum TokenSlugEnums {
  LIVEPEER = "livepeer",
  MATIC = "matic",
  GRAPH = "graph",
}
```

## Chain Configuration

To ensure smooth operation, set up the `mainnet` and `Arbitrum` chain configurations.
The SDK supports both the `mainnet` and `Arbitrum` chains.
The `mainnet` chain is used for `Matic` tokens, while the `Arbitrum` chain supports
`Livepeer` and `Graph` tokens.

First, install the recommended package to manage the chains:

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i wagmi
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  While any chain provider can be used, we recommend wagmi for its seamless
  integration with our SDK.
</Callout>

```typescript filename="Chains"  copy
import { arbitrum, mainnet } from "wagmi/chains";
// Note: While any chain provider can be used, we recommend wagmi for its seamless integration with our SDK.

const mainnetChain = {
  ...mainnet,
};

const arbitrumChain = {
  ...arbitrum,
};

const CHAINS: TenderizeChains = {
  [TokenSlugEnums.MATIC]: mainnetChain, // Matic on mainnet
  [TokenSlugEnums.LIVEPEER]: arbitrumChain, // Livepeer on arbitrum
  [TokenSlugEnums.GRAPH]: arbitrumChain, // Graph on arbitrum
};
```

### Type Definition

The following type definitions are crucial for configuring the SDK CHAINS:

```js filename="Types" copy
export type TenderizeChains = { [token in TokenSlugEnums]?: Chain };
```

### Explanation

In this example, we import the arbitrum and mainnet chains from the wagmi/chains package, which is recommended for use with the Tenderize SDK due to its internal compatibility with wagmi. We then define chain configurations and map token slugs to their respective chains.

`TokenSlugEnums.MATIC`: Configured to use the mainnet chain for `MATIC`.

`TokenSlugEnums.LIVEPEER`: Configured to use the arbitrum chain for `Livepeer`.

`TokenSlugEnums.GRAPH`: Configured to use the arbitrum chain for `The Graph`.

## Tenderizers Configuration

The Tenderize SDK supports `Matic`, `Livepeer`, and `Graph` tokens.
For each token, provide the address of the corresponding tenderizer
to enable staking, withdrawing, and swapping within the SDK.

```js filename="TENDERIZERS" copy
const TENDERIZERS: TenderizersConfig = {
  [TokenSlugEnums.MATIC]: "0x4557B18E779944BFE9d78A672452331C186a9f48",
  [TokenSlugEnums.LIVEPEER]: "0x4557B18E779944BFE9d78A672452331C186a9f48",
  [TokenSlugEnums.GRAPH]: "0x4557B18E779944BFE9d78A672452331C186a9f48",
};
```

### Type Definition

The following type definitions are crucial for configuring the SDK TENDERIZERS:

```js filename="Types" copy
export type TenderizersConfig = { [token in TokenSlugEnums]?: Address };
```

### Explanation

In this example, we import the TenderizersConfig type from the @tenderize/sdk package and define the TENDERIZERS configuration object. This object maps token slugs (such as MATIC, LIVEPEER, and GRAPH) to their respective contract addresses.

`TokenSlugEnums.MATIC`: Represents the token slug for `MATIC`.

`TokenSlugEnums.LIVEPEER`: Represents the token slug for `Livepeer`.

`TokenSlugEnums.GRAPH`: Represents the token slug for The `Graph`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  `Additional Notes`: Ensure you have the correct contract addresses and token
  slugs corresponding to the tokens you intend to configure. This setup is
  crucial for the proper functioning of the Tenderize SDK within your blockchain
  application.
</Callout>

## Token Metadata Configuration

The `tokenMetadata` configuration within the `createTenderizeConfig` function allows for the customization of display names and avatars for supported tokens in the Tenderize SDK. This feature enhances the user interface by providing more intuitive and visually appealing token information.

## `tokenMetadata` Type Definition

```typescript filename="TokenMetadataType" copy
export type TokenMetadata = {
  name: string;
  avatar?: string;
};
```

## Wallet Connect
