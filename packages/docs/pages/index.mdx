# Tenderizers SDK Documentation

Welcome to the Tenderizers SDK documentation. This guide provides comprehensive information to help you get started with the SDK, including setup instructions, detailed guides, and advanced usage scenarios.

## Introduction

Effortlessly integrate tender operations (stake, withdraw, and swap) into your applications with the Tenderizers SDK!

The SDK empowers developers with three seamless integration options:

1. **Provider Integration**: Leverage the SDK's built-in provider for a quick and easy setup.
2. **Custom Provider Integration**: Use your own provider for ultimate flexibility.
3. **Iframe Integration**: Use the SDK within an iframe for enhanced modularity and isolation.

### Provider Integration

Leverage the SDK's built-in provider for a quick and easy setup. This approach allows you to rapidly integrate tender operations without the need for extensive configurations.

### Custom Provider Integration

For ultimate flexibility, use your own provider. This method gives you full control over the integration process, enabling you to tailor the SDK to your specific requirements.

### Iframe Integration

For a seamless integration experience, you can use our SDK with iframes. Simply include the iframe element in your application and pass parameters through the URL. The Tenderizers SDK handles the rest, seamlessly integrating tender operations into your app.
