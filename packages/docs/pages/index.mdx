# Tenderizers SDK Documentation

Welcome to the Tenderizers SDK documentation. This guide provides comprehensive information to help you get started with the SDK, including setup instructions, detailed guides, and advanced usage scenarios.

## Introduction

Effortlessly integrate tender operations (stake, withdraw, and swap) into your applications with the Tenderizers SDK!

The SDK empowers developers with three seamless integration options:

1. **Provider Integration**: Leverage the SDK's built-in provider for a quick and easy setup.
2. **Custom Provider Integration**: Use your own provider for ultimate flexibility.
3. **Iframe Integration**: Use the SDK within an iframe for enhanced modularity and isolation.

## SDK Overview: React SDK

This guide offers comprehensive information about our React SDK, designed to streamline
the integration of our Tenderizers APP into React applications.

## Key Features

The React SDK provides:

- A set of pre-built components and their equivalent Higher-Order Components (HOCs).
- Helper functions based on the React Hooks API.

These features enable seamless interaction with the underlying SDK, facilitating a variety of use cases.

## Repository

For access to the source code and further implementation details, please visit our [React SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/Tenderize/sdk).

## Language Support

The SDK requires **React 17.0.0** or later, as it employs the React Context API.

Several features utilize the React Hooks API, which also necessitates **React 17.0.0** or higher. It is crucial to follow the [rules of React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) when implementing these features. Regarding browser compatibility, the SDK bundle supports all major browsers.

### Provider Integration

Leverage the SDK's built-in provider for a quick and easy setup. This approach allows you to rapidly integrate tender operations without the need for extensive configurations.

### Custom Provider Integration

For ultimate flexibility, use your own provider. This method gives you full control over the integration process, enabling you to tailor the SDK to your specific requirements.

### Iframe Integration

For a seamless integration experience, you can use our SDK with iframes. Simply include the iframe element in your application and pass parameters through the URL. The Tenderizers SDK handles the rest, seamlessly integrating tender operations into your app.
