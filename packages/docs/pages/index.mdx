# Tenderizers SDK Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Tenderizers SDK. This guide
will provide you with everything you need to get started with the SDK,
including setup instructions, detailed guides, and advanced usage scenarios.

## Introduction

Effortlessly integrate tenders (stake, withdraw, and swap) into
your applications with the Tenderizers SDK!

The SDK empowers developers with two seamless integration options:

Provider Integration: Leverage the SDK's built-in provider for a quick and easy setup.
Custom Provider Integration: Bring your own provider for ultimate flexibility.
This documentation guides you through all the necessary steps and configurations for both approaches.

And that's not all! You can also use our SDK with iframes for a truly magical experience.
Simply include the iframe element in your application and pass parameters through the URL.
The Tenderizers SDK handles the rest, seamlessly integrating tenders into your app.
