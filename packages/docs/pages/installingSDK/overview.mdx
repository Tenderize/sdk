# SDK Overview: React SDK

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for our React SDK. This guide offers comprehensive information about our React SDK, designed to streamline the integration of our Tenderizers APP into React applications.

## Key Features

The React SDK provides:

- A set of pre-built components and their equivalent Higher-Order Components (HOCs).
- Helper functions based on the React Hooks API.

These features enable seamless interaction with the underlying SDK, facilitating a variety of use cases.

## Repository

For access to the source code and further implementation details, please visit our [React SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/Tenderize/sdk).

## Language Support

The SDK requires **React 17.0.0** or later, as it employs the React Context API.

Several features utilize the React Hooks API, which also necessitates **React 17.0.0** or higher. It is crucial to follow the [rules of React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) when implementing these features. Regarding browser compatibility, the SDK bundle supports all major browsers.

## Initialization

Setting up the SDK in your codebase involves two primary steps.

### Step 1: Install the SDK

Install the SDK using one of the following package managers:

```js filename="Install" copy
// npm
npm i @tenderize/sdk

// yarn
yarn add @tenderize/sdk

// bun
bun install @tenderize/sdk

// pnpm
pnpm install @tenderize/sdk
```

### Step 2: Import the SDK

After installing, import the SDK into your project as follows:

```js filename="Import" copy
import {
  TenderizeProvider,
  Web3Provider,
  ThemeProvider,
  IframeProvider,
  createTenderizeConfig,
  type TenderizeChains,
  type TenderizersConfig,
} from "@tenderize/sdk";
```
