# ThemeProvider Documentation

## Overview

The `ThemeProvider` component is designed to provide theming capabilities to your application. It allows you to customize and apply consistent styles across your app, including color schemes, font families, and other theme-related properties.

## Usage

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@tenderize/sdk";
import { Theme } from "./your-theme-path";

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={Theme}>
    <YourAppComponents />
  </ThemeProvider>
);

export default App;
```

`When no theme is provided, the default theme is applied.`
